[Jikan API](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/) for provide users preference.\n3. Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00F3lica de Chile for provide servers to run the code.\n\n\n## Inspiration\n\n1. Have an HTML files to experience the scraping exercise without the delay of each requests.\n\n2. Experiment with different types of recommended. For instance, collaborative filtering or based on context like stats, genre, seiyus, reviews, synopsis, etc.\n\n3. Use this information to build a better anime recommended system.\n\n4. Identifying which feature allows us to build the best anime recommended system.\n\n\n## Ideas to the future\n\n1. Build the same dataset with manga and novel.\n\n\n"}
